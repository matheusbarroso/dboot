# dboot
dependent bootstrap

This is a package designed to provide plug-in estimates for the optimal block length estimate in the context of the Moving Block Bootstrap. Currently, only the NPPI algorithm of Lahiri, Furukawa and Lee (2007) is implemented.

## To *install* the package:
Inside **R** console just enter these two line commands:

**library**(devtools) 

**install_github**("matheusbarroso/dboot")
